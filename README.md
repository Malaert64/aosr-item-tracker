# aosr-item-tracker
A visually pleasing little display one can use to keep track of the progression items they've picked up while playing a Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow randomizer.

Written in HTML, CSS, and JS (with jQuery). Feel free to add the GitHub Pages release as a browser source on your stream/recording setup!

Left-click an item's icon to mark it as found, and left-click again to remove it.
